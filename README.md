Password Generator Application using Python:
The application allows users to input their username and specify the desired password length. After clicking the "GENERATE PASSWORD" button, a random password is generated and displayed in a text box. Users can then accept or reset the generated password.
The main components of this Password Generator include:
1-Labels for "Enter user name" and "Enter password length."
2-Entry fields for the user to input their username and desired password length.
3-A "GENERATE PASSWORD" button to trigger the password generation.
4-A text box for displaying the generated password.
5-"ACCEPT" and "RESET" buttons for accepting or resetting the generated password.
When the "GENERATE PASSWORD" button is clicked, it generates a random password composed of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The generated password is then displayed in the text box. Users can click the "ACCEPT" button to accept the generated password or click the "RESET" button to clear the input fields and generated password.

This Password Generator provides a basic user interface for generating and handling passwords interactively.
