# CODSOFT_Projects
I have done four projects using Python(3.11.4).Here is the numbring vise deatils abouts the projects.

1- Password Generator Application using Python:
The application allows users to input their username and specify the desired password length. After clicking the "GENERATE PASSWORD" button, a random password is generated and displayed in a text box. Users can then accept or reset the generated password.
When the "GENERATE PASSWORD" button is clicked, it generates a random password composed of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. The generated password is then displayed in the text box. Users can click the "ACCEPT" button to accept the generated password or click the "RESET" button to clear the input fields and generated password.
Note: This Password Generator provides a basic user interface for generating and handling passwords interactively.

2- Quiz Game using python:
When you run the code, it creates a tkinter window titled "Quiz Game." It presents the questions one by one with shuffled answer options. When the player selects an option and clicks on it, the game checks if the selected answer is correct and updates the score accordingly. After all questions have been answered, a message box displays the player's score.
To play the quiz, you would run this code in a Python environment with tkinter installed. Players can click on the option buttons to select their answers for each question.
Note: You may need to ensure you have the tkinter library installed on your system to run this code successfully, as tkinter is not always included by default in some Python distributions.

3- GUI base Calculator:
This Python code defines a simple calculator application using the Tkinter library. The calculator has a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and parentheses. It can perform basic arithmetic calculations and display the result.

4- To do list application for add/update/delete tasks using python:
The code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a To-Do List app using the tkinter library. It provides the following functionality:
-Users can input tasks into an entry widget.
-Users can add, update, and delete tasks.
-The list of tasks is displayed in a listbox widget.
-Tasks are saved to a file ("tasks.txt") for persistence.
The application provides a simple way to manage tasks, and it stores tasks in a text file so that they can be retrieved even after closing the application.
